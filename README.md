# Inventory-Management-System
## It is cli based Inventory Management System

## Note : Download the zip file and extract all the file then create a folder named 'Project' then put all the file in this folder. Because i provided Relative path in my code for creating record.json and selled data.json. 

I'm seperated all the File in One single file that is available in All-in-one folder.
 
All_in_one.py file contains all the functionality.
 

 
## Summary :
 
If you want to add some new item, you can run AddingProduct.py or All_in_one.py. if you run All_in_one.py just select 0(zero) for adding items. after adding new     item you can see record.json file
 
If you want to sell the item, you can run SellingProduct.py or All_in_one.py. if you run All_in_one.py just select 1(one) for selling items. after selling item you can see remaining quantity of item in record.json file.
